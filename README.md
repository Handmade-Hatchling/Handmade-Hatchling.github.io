Where handmade is always better!


<p>
	Hi there! Thanks for stopping by! My name is Jennifer. I have an affinity for all things handmade and believe there is more soul and meaning in the things we create ourselves. I have a degree in Interior and Floral Design. While one day I plan to dive into an Interior Design career, presently I am happily caring for my family.

	I love decorating my home, crocheting, and baking. I’m always eager to learn new skills and techniques and will be sharing my handmade adventures with you all. Here at Handmade Hatchling you’ll find DIY’s, tutorials, recipes and even sneak peeks at what I’ll be adding to my Etsy shop.

	I’m so glad you visited!
